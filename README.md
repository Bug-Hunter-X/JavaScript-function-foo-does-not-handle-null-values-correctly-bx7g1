# JavaScript Bug: Incorrect Null Handling in Function foo

This repository demonstrates a common JavaScript bug related to incorrect null handling in a function. The function `foo` uses strict equality (`===`) to check for `null` values, which can lead to unexpected behavior if the function is called with arguments that may be `null` or `undefined`.

## Bug Description

The `foo` function is designed to add two numbers. However, it incorrectly handles cases where either or both arguments are `null`.  Using strict equality (`===`) means that `null` and `0` are treated as distinct values, which is usually not desired when checking for the absence of a value.

## Bug Solution

The solution involves replacing the strict equality check (`===`) with a loose equality check (`==`).  This allows `null`, `undefined`, and `0` to be handled more flexibly and often as equivalent in the context of checking for an absence of a value. This is crucial because often the desired behavior is to treat a missing number value as a 0.

## How to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run the `bug.js` file. Observe the incorrect output when calling `foo` with null.
3. Run the `bugSolution.js` file to see the corrected version.
